CDTRACK is a command-line utility program that allows the caller to play a
specific track (or range of tracks) on the CD-ROM Drive.  Please read the
source code for additional details.

Usage:  CDTRACK <start> <stop>

        where <start> and <stop> are track numbers.
           if both parameters are omitted, CDTRACK plays only track 1.
           if only <start> is provided, CDTRACK plays that track only.
           otherwise, CDTRACK plays from <start> to the end of <stop>.
